üèÅ Getting Started
This project is a single, self-contained index.html file, so no complex build steps or installations are needed.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser.

A code editor like Visual Studio Code.

Running Locally
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-pulse.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd crypto-pulse
Open the index.html file in your browser.

For the best development experience, I recommend using the Live Server extension for VS Code. Simply right-click the index.html file and select Open with Live Server.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application logic is encapsulated within a single Vue instance.

Data Fetching: When the component is mounted, the fetchData() method is called to get initial data from the CoinGecko API.

Reactivity: The fetched data is stored in the coins array. Vue's reactivity system automatically updates the DOM to display the list.

Live Updates: setInterval is used to call fetchData() every 60 seconds.

Animations on Update: A unique updateKey is incremented after each successful fetch. This key is bound to the <tbody> element (:key="updateKey"), which efficiently tells Vue to re-render the entire table body, re-triggering the CSS animations for all rows and cells.
